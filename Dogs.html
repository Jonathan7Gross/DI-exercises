<h2>Greyhounds</h2>
<p>
	The Greyhound is a breed of dog, a <b>sitehound</b> which has been bred for coursing game and greyhound racing. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a <i>resurgence</i> in popularity as a family pet. It is also referred to as an English Greyhound.

<h2>Pitbulls</h2>
<p>
	Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers. The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous, as it encompasses a range of pedigree breeds, informal types and appearances that cannot be reliably identified.
